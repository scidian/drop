# Drop Creator

Drop Creator is a no code, drag and drop, 2.5D game engine written in C++. It is built on Qt, OpenGL, and [Chipmunk Physics](https://chipmunk-physics.net/).

## Status

<div align="center"><b>***** NOT IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT *****</b></div>
<br>

After attempting to contact the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) company in regards to licensing and receiving no feedback, development on Drop was halted. We have shifted away from C++ / Qt / OpenGL to a web first JavaScript / WebGL tech stack. Current efforts are targeted on the [Onsight Engine](https://github.com/onsightengine).

## Documentation

An introduction to Drop and the beginning of a user manual can be found [online](https://docs.drop.scidian.com/).
