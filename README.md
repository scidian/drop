# Drop Creator

Drop Creator is a no code, drag and drop, 2.5D game engine written in C++. It is built on Qt, OpenGL, and [Chipmunk Physics](https://chipmunk-physics.net/).

## Status

<b>***** NOT IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT *****</b>
<br><br>
<b>After attempting to contact the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) company in regards to licensing and receiving no feedback, development on Drop was halted. We have shifted away from C++ / Qt / OpenGL to a web first JavaScript / WebGL model. Current efforts are targeted on the [Onsight Engine](https://github.com/onsightengine).</b>
